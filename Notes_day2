AutoML -> for loop of 2 types:

1. Algorithm [SVM, Log, DT, RF…]
2. HP loop [LR, L1/L2, epoch, …]

- You get a starting point 
- You get model explanation 

GMEK- google manage, rotates
CMEK- google creates, you manage and rotate
CSEK- you generate and manage and rotate

File System- GCS
Csv- 3 copies- sharding 

Parquet- encrypted!

Early Stopping:

1. Model Performance- metric 
2. Time - Node Hours (budget), Max time I have for deployment [SDK]


1- Model Performance
	a) Median - all models below median performance are dropped
	b) Truncation - every model below a Metric X will be dropped
	c) Slack Factor- score or ratio
